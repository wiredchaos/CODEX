1. WHAT WIRED CHAOS IS
Wired Chaos is framed as a multiverse alternate-reality game and creator economy that uses documentation, governance rules, and onboarding briefs to move participants from Web2 familiarity into structured Web3 experiences while tracking evidence through CRAB governance records.

2. ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS
- CHAOS OS / CRAB Governance: Kernel, state, runbook, and patch queues that set rules for contributions and evidence.
- WIRED CHAOS META: Fashion Design Swarm program outlining onboarding, curriculum, and economy behaviors.
- FEN / VRG33589 / 589 numerology: Mentioned as identifiers and rarity caps within documents; no active modules observed.
- Vaults and DCA Engine: Designer vault receiving a fee stream that powers automated reinvestment.
- Agents and Automation: NEURO authority, maintainers, contributors, and GitHub Actions that sort and ingest ZIP evidence.
- Mirrors: Conceptual storefront mirror (university bookstore) for digital and physical SKUs.
- Trinity/3DT Audits: Placeholder audit catalogs awaiting transcripts to validate installations and gaps.
- Documentation Stack: Repository maps, upload contracts, production checklists guiding operational flow.

3. ECONOMY & CHAIN JURISDICTION
- DOGE role: Primary chain for inscription-based NFTs with controlled supply using numerology limits and low-fee expectations.
- XRPL role: No role documented in exports.
- BASE role: No role documented in exports.
- SOLANA role: No role documented in exports.
- MONEY MAXI principle: Fees routed to minimal-cost chains with payouts in fiat or DOGE, prioritizing efficient settlement.

4. VAULTS, NFTs & 404 DYNAMICS
- Vaults are intent-based treasury balances rather than custody wallets, with a 3% fee siphoned to a DCA engine to reinvest creator earnings.
- NFTs are DOGE inscriptions with layered trait artifacts, burn-to-upgrade mechanics, and rarity curves defined by Fibonacci-style caps; ERC-404 is mentioned only as a searched keyword with no supporting detail.
- Users experience non-random minting tied to performance milestones, with internal balance models emphasizing the consequence of seed loss.

5. VALORITHIM (FORENSIC SEARCH MEMORY)
- No forensic memory or reputation system is described; searches found only references to transcript scanning mechanics.
- Because no model is documented, nothing is tracked beyond ingest scripts looking for keywords, and no privacy constraints are specified.
- Access difficulty or economy impacts from a Valorithim are absent in the exports.

6. MULTIVERSE MIRRORS
- Only a university bookstore mirror is noted as a commerce concept for digital and physical merchandise.
- Mirrors are intended to bridge familiar retail contexts to on-chain drops, easing newcomers into Web3 commerce.
- With no UI present, mirrors remain conceptual but align with the Web2-to-Web3 onboarding path.

7. AGENTS, PATCHES & GOVERNANCE
- NEURO acts as final authority on CRAB changes, with maintainers enforcing evidence and testing rules and contributors proposing patches.
- Changes flow through a runbook-driven PR process, with patch queues and state tables capturing priorities and classifications.
- Governance integrates CRAB/PATCH queues and automation workflows that ingest evidence and guard ZIP placement, aligning oversight with codified procedures.

8. ONBOARDING FOR 5 GENERATIONS
- Tiered onboarding moves from free design challenges to foundational garment skills, then 3D construction and parametric design, culminating in dynamic NFT commerce and studio access.
- Accessibility guidance is not defined; neurodivergent-first practices are pending future specification.

9. DEPLOYMENT & WORKSPACE ADAPTATION
- New workspaces need Python 3.11+, INBOX_UPLOADS for ZIP intake, and the ability to run ingest/sorter scripts or GitHub Actions to refresh manifests and audit docs.
- Non-developers can ignore build tooling; focus is on following upload contracts, production checklists, and governance evidence flows.

10. ONE-PAGE TL;DR
- Multiverse ARG economy guided by CRAB governance and fashion-focused META brief.
- DOGE inscriptions with controlled supply anchor NFT activity; other chains not yet defined.
- Vault fees power DCA reinvestment; internal balances emphasize custody caution.
- No Valorithim or reputation engine present in exports.
- Mirrors are conceptual storefronts to bridge Web2 commerce into on-chain drops.
- Agents include NEURO authority, maintainers, and contributors, plus automation for ZIP ingest.
- Patch and state queues track priorities and gaps, awaiting transcript evidence for Trinity audits.
- Onboarding is progressive from challenges to advanced commerce, with explicit non-random minting ethos.
- Deployment needs Python tooling and ZIP workflows; Vercel configs absent.
- Evidence-first operations rely on manifests, audit docs, and PR-based governance.

Gaps / TODOs: Whitelist and gating rules are undefined; Valorithim model is absent; XRPL/Base/Solana roles are not documented; UI/mirror implementations are missing; neurodivergent accessibility requirements remain to be written.
