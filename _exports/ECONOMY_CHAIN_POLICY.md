# Economy and Chain Policy Snapshot

## Chain Jurisdiction Rules
- Minting occurs on **DOGE inscriptions**; no random minting and numerology limits (333 / 589 / 999).【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L55】
- Fees are restricted to "minimal chains" with payouts in **fiat or DOGE only**, emphasizing low-cost settlement.【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L58】

## Asset Types per Chain
- **DOGE**: Base NFTs and layered trait artifacts minted via inscriptions; burn-to-upgrade mechanics and Fibonacci rarity curves.【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L55】
- Other chains (XRPL, XRP, Base, Solana, ERC-404/404): **No evidence found** in this repository snapshot.

## Vault Model (Intent vs Custody)
- A **Designer Vault** receives a **3% fee routed to a DCA engine**, suggesting semi-custodial treasury management tied to creator earnings.【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L58】
- Wallet model is "Starbucks-style internal balance," implying account-based balances for users rather than self-custodied wallets; seed loss has real consequences by design.【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L58】

## DCA Strategy Model
- DCA is funded via the 3% vault fee; specific cadence/targets are unspecified, indicating an automated reinvestment sink fed by marketplace activity.【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L38-L58】

## Whitelist / Gating Model
- Gating concepts are hinted via Trinity keyword lists (e.g., "gating", "vault", "permission"), but no concrete whitelist flows or enforcement rules are documented in accessible files.【F:scripts/vercel_zip_ingest.py†L18-L46】【F:TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md†L1-L31】
- No explicit allowlist/whitelist policy is defined for minting or vault access in the current CRAB docs.

## Other Keyword Mentions
- **FEN / VRG33589 / 589**: Present only as repository names or numerology limits; no active chain policies beyond the 589 rarity numerology noted above.【F:STATE.md†L1-L33】【F:FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md†L45-L55】
- **Vault** references outside the fashion brief are limited to Trinity keyword scans and do not describe custody mechanics.【F:scripts/vercel_zip_ingest.py†L18-L46】
