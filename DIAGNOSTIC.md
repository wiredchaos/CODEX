# Repository Diagnostic: Wired Chaos

## Overview
- Repository appears to be a freshly initialized project with minimal content.
- Only tracked file at repository root is `README.md`.

## Inventory
- File listing (excluding `.git`):
  - `README.md`

## Git Status
- Current branch: `work`.
- Working tree is clean with no uncommitted changes detected during this diagnostic.

## Notes
- No additional project files, configuration, or dependency manifests are present yet.
- Next steps likely include adding project source files, configuration, and documentation to define repository purpose and usage.
