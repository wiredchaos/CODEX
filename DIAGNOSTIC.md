# Repository Diagnostic: Wired Chaos

## Overview
- Repository currently contains only root-level documentation; source code and configuration files have not yet been added.
- Intended to serve as the baseline for the Wired Chaos workflow and codex documentation.

## Repository Structure
```
/                     # Root of repository
├─ README.md          # High-level repository label
└─ DIAGNOSTIC.md      # Current diagnostic and structure notes
```

## Git Status
- Current branch: `work`.
- Working tree is clean with no uncommitted changes.

## Notes and Recommendations
- Establish project purpose and usage guidance in `README.md` once requirements are defined.
- Add source directories (e.g., `src/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`) and configuration manifests as the project evolves.
- Consider initializing tooling (version control workflow, formatting, linting) when code is introduced.
