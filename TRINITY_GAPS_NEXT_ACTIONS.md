# TRINITY GAPS AND NEXT ACTIONS

## Missing evidence items
- No Vercel chat/build transcripts or patch logs are present under `VERCEL_HISTORY/` to identify legs or consumer declarations.
- No code-based Trinity/3DT indicators were found in `CODEX` beyond placeholder references.
- Access to other WIRED CHAOS repositories (e.g., `wired-chaos`, `v0-*`) is unavailable for verification.

## Files or artifacts needed to resolve UNKNOWN statuses
- Exported Vercel build chats or patch transcripts (e.g., `VERCEL_HISTORY/VERCEL_DUMP.md` or dated files with patch names and repo references).
- Any consumer declaration snippets or Trinity mount notes included in those transcripts.
- Read-only snapshots or logs from external WIRED CHAOS repositories showing Trinity Core references, registries/manifests, EnvironmentRenderer usage, or timeline door/gating details.

## Next 3 safe patches (documentation-only) to reduce UNKNOWN → CONFIRMED
1. Add aggregated or dated Vercel transcripts to `VERCEL_HISTORY/`, ensuring patch names, repo targets, and any Trinity indicators are included.
2. If external repositories contain Trinity references, document the file paths and excerpts in `TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md` via read-only snapshots (no code changes).
3. Supply registry/manifest and consumer declaration details (read-only) that show how timeline doors (NETERU / SIGNAL ERA / RVP) are gated, enabling classification against the required pieces checklist.
# Trinity Gaps and Next Actions

Evidence gaps remain because Trinity/3DT artifacts are not present in this workspace.

## Missing Evidence
- Vercel chat/build transcripts (none found under `VERCEL_HISTORY/` after recursive scan).
- Any repository files containing Trinity/3DT indicators within CODEX.
- Defined checklist of required pieces for Trinity installation.

## Evidence Needed
- Exported transcript files placed under `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/` (use dated folders or `undated/`) so CRAB legs can be indexed.
- File paths within accessible repos showing Trinity/3DT keywords (e.g., `3DT`, `TRINITY`, `WebGPU-3DT`, `EnvironmentRenderer`, 
`patchId="CLEAR"`).
- A populated `TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md` detailing the required components to verify installs.

## Next 3 Documentation-Only Actions
1. Upload Vercel transcript exports as text (`.md/.txt/.json`) into `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/` and log them in `_MANIFEST.json`; t
hen regenerate the CRAB legs index.
2. Author the authoritative Trinity required pieces checklist in `TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md` so each repo/leg can be audited con
sistently.
3. Re-scan the CODEX repository for Trinity/3DT indicators once evidence exists and update `TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md` with conf
irmed statuses and checklist results.
- Vercel chat/build transcripts (`VERCEL_HISTORY/` directory is absent).
- Any repository files containing Trinity/3DT indicators.
- Defined checklist of required pieces for Trinity installation.

## Evidence Needed
- Exported transcript files placed under `VERCEL_HISTORY/` (any format) to enable CRAB leg indexing.
- File paths within accessible repos showing Trinity/3DT keywords (e.g., `3DT`, `TRINITY`, `WebGPU-3DT`, `EnvironmentRenderer`, `patchId="CLEAR"`).
- A populated `TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md` detailing the required components to verify installs.

## Next 3 Documentation-Only Actions
1. Export Vercel chat/build transcripts and add them to `VERCEL_HISTORY/`, then re-run the CRAB leg index.
2. Provide or author the official Trinity required pieces checklist in `TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md` so each repo/leg can be audited consistently.
3. Re-scan accessible repositories for the Trinity/3DT keywords once evidence is available and update `TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md` with confirmed statuses.
