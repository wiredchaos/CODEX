# TRINITY GAPS AND NEXT ACTIONS

## Missing evidence items
- No Vercel chat/build transcripts or patch logs are present under `VERCEL_HISTORY/` to identify legs or consumer declarations.
- No code-based Trinity/3DT indicators were found in `CODEX` beyond placeholder references.
- Access to other WIRED CHAOS repositories (e.g., `wired-chaos`, `v0-*`) is unavailable for verification.

## Files or artifacts needed to resolve UNKNOWN statuses
- Exported Vercel build chats or patch transcripts (e.g., `VERCEL_HISTORY/VERCEL_DUMP.md` or dated files with patch names and repo references).
- Any consumer declaration snippets or Trinity mount notes included in those transcripts.
- Read-only snapshots or logs from external WIRED CHAOS repositories showing Trinity Core references, registries/manifests, EnvironmentRenderer usage, or timeline door/gating details.

## Next 3 safe patches (documentation-only) to reduce UNKNOWN → CONFIRMED
1. Add aggregated or dated Vercel transcripts to `VERCEL_HISTORY/`, ensuring patch names, repo targets, and any Trinity indicators are included.
2. If external repositories contain Trinity references, document the file paths and excerpts in `TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md` via read-only snapshots (no code changes).
3. Supply registry/manifest and consumer declaration details (read-only) that show how timeline doors (NETERU / SIGNAL ERA / RVP) are gated, enabling classification against the required pieces checklist.
