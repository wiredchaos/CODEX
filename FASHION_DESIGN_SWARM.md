# WIRED CHAOS META — FASHION DESIGN SWARM (FDS-1)

Purpose: Onboard Web2 fashion designers into Web3 by teaching design, 3D, code, and on-chain commerce simultaneously, using dripONchain™ as the live laboratory. This is not a course; it is on-the-job training inside a simulated decentralized economy.

## 1. Swarm Architecture

| Agent | Role |

| CUTMASTER | Patternmaking and garment construction logic |
| TEXTILE-AI | Fabric physics, materials, shaders |
| DRAPE-ENGINE | CLO/Blender/Marvelous Designer logic |
| AVATAR-FORGE | Wearable compatibility and rigging |
| CHAIN-LOOM | NFT traits, DOGE inscriptions, mint logic |
| MERCH-VAULT | Bookstore and dripONchain commerce |
| RUNWAY-SIM | Virtual runway and OTT integration |
| FASHION-BOT | Discord/Telegram mentor and critiques |

All agents report into NEURO BRAIN.

## 2. Curriculum (FIDM → WIRED CHAOS Upgrade)

### Year 1 — Foundations (Web2 → Web3)
- **FDS-101: Fashion Fundamentals** — Silhouette theory; proportion and balance; historical references (abstracted, non-geopolitical).
- **FDS-102: Color, Texture and Form** — Color systems; material behavior; digital textile logic.
- **FDS-103: Pattern Logic** — Flat vs. 3D patterns; parametric garment systems.
- **In-Game Output:** Unlocked base garment traits (Common); minted as non-tradable prototypes.

### Year 2 — 3D and Avatar Wearables
- **FDS-201: 3D Garment Construction** — CLO/Blender workflows; physics-driven drape.
- **FDS-202: Avatar Fit Systems** — Body-agnostic fitting; modular wearable slots.
- **FDS-203: Rigging and Skin Weights** — Game-ready assets; performance optimization.
- **In-Game Output:** Wearable NFTs (upgradeable); traits unlocked via skill performance, not RNG.

### Year 3 — Code and Generative Fashion
- **FDS-301: Code-Driven Design** — Parametric garments; trait-based generation; logic-based rarity (not random).
- **FDS-302: Dynamic Fashion NFTs** — Mutable metadata; burn-to-upgrade mechanics; layer-based evolution (333 / 589 / 999).
- **FDS-303: Fashion Systems Engineering** — Supply chains; digital-to-physical mirroring.
- **In-Game Output:** Dynamic wearables; upgradeable through gameplay plus CHAOS_CREDITS.

### Year 4 — Commerce and Runway
- **FDS-401: dripONchain™ Economy** — Pricing models; scarcity logic; drop strategy.
- **FDS-402: University Bookstore Mirror** — Each school = unique merch; digital plus phygital SKUs.
- **FDS-403: Runway Simulation** — Virtual shows; 789 Studios OTT broadcasts.
- **Capstone Output:** Designer Vault; royalty-enabled collections; DOGE inscription master pieces.

## 3. Minting and Trait Mechanics
- No random mint.
- Traits unlocked by skill, XP, behavioral performance, and burn events.
- **NFT Structure:** Base NFT = shell; traits are layered, purchasable, and earnable; burn artifacts to unlock next tier; each layer requires all artifacts to advance.
- **Numerology Enforcement:** 333 / 589 / 999 only; Fibonacci rarity curves; no exceptions.

## 4. Blockchain Rules
- Mint chain: DOGE (inscriptions).
- Accepted payments: all listed.
- Payouts: fiat or DOGE only.
- Fees: minimal chains only.
- Vault: 3% fee → DCA engine.
- Wallet: Starbucks-style internal balance.
- Seed phrase loss carries real consequences by design.

## 5. Discord / Telegram Fashion Bot
- Capabilities: design critiques; trait unlock notifications; drop countdowns; vault balance alerts; mentor feedback loops.
- Behavior: acts like a studio professor, not a chatbot.

## 6. Funnel (Built-In)
1. Free design challenge.
2. Unlock prototype wearable.
3. Enter dripONchain lab.
4. Earn → Mint → Upgrade.
5. Graduate to paid drops.
6. Optional DFY / Studio access.

## 7. Name and Brand
- Program name: **dripONchain™ Fashion Lab**.
- Tone: high fashion × cyber × artisan × future.
- No race labels; diversity expressed through form, texture, light, shadow, and energy.
- Dark skin + purple eyes framed as aesthetic power, not identity tagging.

## 8. Next Execution (PM Locked)
- Fashion Trait Catalog Expansion (500+ traits).
- 3D Mockup Automation Swarm.
- University Bookstore Engine.
- Runway OTT Module for 789 Studios.
- Designer Vault Dashboard.

PM lead: WIRED CHAOS META.
