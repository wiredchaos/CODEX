# STATE (CRAB Snapshot)

This snapshot captures the observable state of WIRED CHAOS repositories based on in-repo documentation. Repository visibility is currently fragmented; only CODEX and NPC consistently appear publicly, and GitHub occasionally errors when listing repos. Unknowns are kept explicit.

## Repositories and Classification
- **CODEX** — Documentation; holds governance assets (CRAB). Status: Active (CRAB).
- **NPC** — Documentation; scope unclear from available materials. Status: Limited visibility (PATCH candidate).
- **wired-chaos** — JavaScript; active application per prior report. Status: PATCH.
- **v0-use-wcmhub-v-1-0** — TypeScript prototype. Status: PATCH.
- **v0-WCMSTR** — TypeScript prototype. Status: PATCH.
- **v0-789** — TypeScript prototype. Status: PATCH.
- **v0-CLEAR** — TypeScript infrastructure/tooling. Status: PATCH.
- **NPC-12** — TypeScript infrastructure/tooling. Status: PATCH.
- **WC-MPCR** — TypeScript prototype. Status: PATCH.
- **VRG-ECHO-ENGINEERS** — TypeScript prototype. Status: PATCH.
- **v0-wc-dicbot** — TypeScript; active application. Status: PATCH.
- **FigmawcproductionDesign** — TypeScript; documentation-heavy. Status: PATCH (design assets).
- **fastapi** — Python; active application. Status: PATCH.
- **TAX-SUITE-** — No primary language; appears inactive. Status: Archive candidate.
- **FEN** — No primary language; appears inactive. Status: Archive candidate.
- **NPC** — Documentation; limited signals. Status: PATCH (low visibility).
- **Figmawcchaos** — TypeScript; documentation-focused. Status: PATCH (design assets).
- **codex-neteru** — No primary language; documentation. Status: PATCH (conceptual).

## Activity Signals (known)
- Activity levels are inferred from existing documentation; direct commit metadata was not available in this snapshot.
- CI/CD presence, issue trackers, and release cadences are unknown for most repos.

## Reality Gaps
- Repository list may be incomplete due to GitHub UI errors or private repositories.
- Last update timestamps and maintainers are not yet captured; collecting them is a priority PATCH.
- Runtime environments and deployment targets are undefined in CRAB; PATCH proposals must include evidence when adding such details.
