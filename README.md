# CODEX

WIRED CHAOS WORKFLOW PUBLISH CODEX

## Copilot prompt
See [COPILOT_PROMPT.md](COPILOT_PROMPT.md) for the recommended Copilot Chat prompt to synchronize on the WIRED CHAOS organization.

## Org synchronization report
For the latest synthesized view of the WIRED CHAOS GitHub organization, review the [ORG_SYNCHRONIZATION_REPORT.md](ORG_SYNCHRONIZATION_REPORT.md).

## Fashion Design Swarm
The [FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md](FASHION_DESIGN_SWARM.md) brief captures the FDS-1 onboarding blueprint for bringing Web2 fashion designers into the dripONchain™ lab.

## CRAB Kernel and Patch Board
Start here for governance and coordination:
- [KERNEL.md](KERNEL.md) — authority model and operating rules.
- [STATE.md](STATE.md) — current snapshot of repositories and classifications.
- [PATCHES.md](PATCHES.md) — prioritized patch queue with owners and definitions of done.
- [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) — step-by-step workflow for agents and maintainers.

## Trinity / 3DT audit (status only)
- [CRAB_LEGS_INDEX.md](CRAB_LEGS_INDEX.md) — Vercel transcript index; currently waiting on exports.
- [TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md](TRINITY_INSTALL_CATALOG.md) — repo and transcript status by evidence.
- [TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md](TRINITY_REQUIRED_PIECES.md) — checklist placeholder for required components.
- [TRINITY_GAPS_NEXT_ACTIONS.md](TRINITY_GAPS_NEXT_ACTIONS.md) — missing evidence and next documentation steps.

## Portfolio Multiverse (non-developer view)
- Open `portfolio_multiverse/index.html` locally or on a static host to enter the galaxy lobby immediately (no builds required).
- Stars represent every `-3DT` patch from the registry; click a star to drop into its 3D room or open the Trinity Elevator to ride timelines.
- Locks are enforced visually: soft-locked rooms glow amber, hard-locked rooms are hidden ghosts until your `user_state.json` meets the rules.
- Rendering is STUB_RUNTIME-only; future engines can mount into the shared room container without changing patch content.

## Portfolio Multiverse CODEX prompt
Use [`PORTFOLIO_MULTIVERSE_CODEX_PROMPT.md`](PORTFOLIO_MULTIVERSE_CODEX_PROMPT.md) as the paste-ready CODEX instruction set to build the WOW-first immersive lobby, Trinity Elevator, and registry-driven rooms with Akashic skipping in the WIRED CHAOS MAIN repository.

## How uploads work
Uploads are drop-only: place `.zip` files in `INBOX_UPLOADS/` via **Add file → Upload files**, commit, then let automation unpack, update docs, and open a PR. Check the latest **Ingest Vercel ZIP exports** run in the **Actions** tab and review the PR for extracted files and refreshed audit docs.

- [UPLOAD_CONTRACT.md](UPLOAD_CONTRACT.md) — plain-language rules and what happens automatically.
- [PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md](PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md) — step-by-step checks for upload, automation, verification, and merge.
