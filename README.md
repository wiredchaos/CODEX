## CRAB Kernel and Patch Board

- [KERNEL.md](KERNEL.md) — authority model and operating rules.
- [STATE.md](STATE.md) — current snapshot of repositories and classifications.
- [PATCHES.md](PATCHES.md) — prioritized patch queue with owners and definitions of done.
- [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) — step-by-step workflow for agents and maintainers.

## WIRED CHAOS Intake Protocol UI

The Next.js intake panel provides a 3DT job creator and live status console. Run it locally:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:3000 and submit intake payloads. The UI will create a job, poll its status, and surface artifacts when complete.
