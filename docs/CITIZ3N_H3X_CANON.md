# CITIZ3N.H3X — Canonical Perimeter Spec

CITIZ3N.H3X is the living perimeter interface that surrounds the WIRED CHAOS Swarm Room.
It is not a dashboard, repo browser, or settings panel.
It is the hex-grid city you traverse before entering deeper rooms.

## Core Identity
- **Terrain, not UI:** Users arrive in a city, not a screen.
- **Streets, not menus:** Navigation is spatial and directional.
- **Districts, not tabs:** Capabilities are neighborhoods with rules and mood.
- **Checkpoints, not popups:** Trust, scope, and permission are felt as gates.

## Spatial Reframe of Core Components

### 1) The Hex Grid (Zones of Capability)
Each hex represents a zone with:
- a function cluster
- a permission boundary
- a trust level
- a system state

Behavioral rules:
- **Inactive hexes** feel cold, dim, distant, or silent.
- **Active hexes** hum, flicker, or draw attention.
- **Boundary crossing** is a deliberate decision; the city acknowledges the crossing.

### 2) Integrations (Foreign Embassies)
Integrations are no longer connected services. They are embassies inside the city.

Each embassy:
- occupies its own structure
- has guards (auth, scopes, tokens)
- exposes only specific doors
- reacts to your standing

Canonical mappings:
- **Blender** → Blender District (creative assembly ward)
- **Godot** → Simulation Ward (world-building sector)
- **dYad** → Fabrication Quarter (forging / synthesis zone)
- **Vercel** → Deployment Consulate (launch corridor)
- **GitHub** → Archive & Treaty House (source-truth gate)

Failure behavior:
- Embassies **lock, flicker, or evacuate**. They do not show generic errors.
- An unavailable embassy **recedes** rather than breaking the city.

### 3) Build System & Dev Tools (The Foundry)
Build pipelines are physical, not textual.

Rules:
- You **approach** the foundry to initiate a build.
- You **place artifacts** into it to start ignition.
- **Warnings** appear as sparks.
- **Errors** appear as cracks or structural strain.
- **Success** becomes a completed object you can inspect.

State meaning:
- Blank output means **the foundry never lit** (a state, not a bug).

### 4) Agents in CITIZ3N.H3X (Sentinels, Runners, Engineers)
These are not core WIRED CHAOS agents. They are perimeter actors.

Roles:
- **Sentinels** patrol boundaries and watch trust edges.
- **Runners** escort artifacts between districts.
- **Engineers** intervene when flows stall or systems degrade.

Behavior:
- If nothing is happening, they **idle**.
- If something breaks, they **converge**.
- You do not read logs; you **watch their reactions**.

### 5) Governance in the Perimeter (Border Control)
Governance is expressed as spatial access and response.

Rules:
- **Deploy / patch / fork / observe / override** are spatial privileges.
- Low-trust users **see powerful zones** but cannot enter them.
- Audited systems feel tense: **paths narrow, agents cluster**.

Governance is felt, not explained.

## Relationship to WIRED CHAOS META
CITIZ3N.H3X is outside the Swarm Room but inside the world.

Flow:
1. User arrives in the **CITIZ3N.H3X perimeter city**.
2. They traverse **hex districts** (capabilities, builds, integrations).
3. They cross a **threshold**.
4. They enter the **WIRED CHAOS Swarm Room** (core intelligence).

“Flat SaaS mode” becomes a static map of the city viewed from above—functional, but dead.

## State Clarity (Resolved Ambiguity)
- “Nothing happens” → **No agents are active.**
- “Output blank” → **You are in an unpowered zone.**
- “System doesn’t do anything” → **No ritual was triggered.**

## Canonical Rule Going Forward
For every CITIZ3N.H3X element, answer:
1. Where does this exist spatially?
2. What does it feel like to approach?
3. Who guards it?
4. What changes when it activates?
5. What does failure look like in space?

If a component cannot answer these, it does not belong in CITIZ3N.H3X.

## Changelog
- 2025-12-19: Established the canonical perimeter specification for CITIZ3N.H3X and mapped all core moving parts to spatial behaviors.
