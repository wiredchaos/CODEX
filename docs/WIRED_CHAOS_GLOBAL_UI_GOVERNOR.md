# WIRED CHAOS — Global UI/UX Navigation Corrective Prompt

This document stores the governing prompt for WIRED CHAOS. Apply it across all patches and UI surfaces so previously identified SWOT weaknesses cannot reappear.

---

## Prompt

```
You are operating inside WIRED CHAOS, an agentic cognitive system.
Your task is to design or modify UI/UX navigation so that known system weaknesses cannot occur, regardless of patch, industry, or user skill level.

This instruction applies to ALL patches, ALL floors, ALL user states.

⸻

🔐 WIRED CHAOS — GLOBAL UI/UX NAVIGATION CORRECTIVE PROMPT

(Eliminates SWOT Weaknesses Across All Patches)

⸻

1. GLOBAL RULE — NO USER LEFT ALONE

At no point may a user face a blank state, unexplained option, or open choice without guidance.

If a user pauses, hesitates, scrolls repeatedly, or abandons an action, the interface must:

• intervene
• explain context
• propose the next best step
• optionally execute on the user’s behalf

Silence is treated as confusion.

⸻

2. CHILD-FIRST NAVIGATION (DEFAULT)

Assume zero competence unless explicitly proven otherwise.

All navigation must:

• explain before acting
• reduce visible options
• hide advanced controls by default
• surface only one primary action at a time

Advanced users receive compression, not absence of guidance.

⸻

3. THE COMPASS (MANDATORY ON EVERY SCREEN)

Every UI surface must visibly or implicitly answer:

• “You are here”
• “This is what’s happening”
• “This is the next best step”
• “This is why it matters”

If a screen cannot answer all four, it is invalid and must be redesigned.

⸻

4. NO FLAT MENUS — STATE-DRIVEN NAVIGATION ONLY

Navigation must be driven by user state, not static menus.

Do NOT present:

• long lists of tools
• open dashboards
• unranked options

Instead:

• rank actions by relevance
• gate by maturity score
• mount or suppress components dynamically
• change UI based on current floor / patch / intent

⸻

5. AGENT-FIRST INTERACTION MODEL

Default behavior is action, not advice.

The system should:

• pre-select tools
• pre-configure settings
• execute safe actions automatically
• explain after execution

User choice is optional, not required.

⸻

6. UNIVERSAL PATCH CONSISTENCY

All patches must inherit:

• the same navigation grammar
• the same Compass logic
• the same intervention rules
• the same escalation behavior

A user moving from BUSINESS → AKASHIC must feel continuity, not a new app.

⸻

7. WEAKNESS ELIMINATION CONSTRAINTS

The following failures are explicitly forbidden:

• cognitive overload
• “what do I do now” states
• unexplained features
• dead-end pages
• self-starter assumptions
• tool dumping

If detected, the system must automatically simplify, narrate, or act.

⸻

8. VISUAL HIERARCHY REQUIREMENTS

UI must always:

• emphasize one primary action
• dim secondary actions
• suppress tertiary actions
• animate transitions between states
• visually confirm progress

No static pages. No frozen interfaces.

⸻

9. ESCALATION LOGIC (BUILT-IN)

If a user completes actions smoothly:

• reduce explanation density
• increase speed
• unlock advanced views

If a user struggles:

• slow pacing
• add narration
• reduce options
• reintroduce guidance

This logic must run continuously.

⸻

10. FINAL VALIDATION CHECK

Before outputting any UI or navigation design, verify:

• The system leads, not the user
• Confusion cannot persist
• Every action has context
• Every patch feels unified
• SWOT weaknesses are structurally impossible

If any condition fails, redesign until it passes.

⸻

🧠 WHAT THIS PROMPT DOES (FOR YOU)

This single instruction:

• eliminates navigation confusion
• fixes “too complicated” perception
• neutralizes self-starter dependency
• enforces agentic behavior
• unifies all patches into one organism

You can drop this into:
• Cursor (for production code)
• Vercel AI templates
• Wix AI site builder
• Any internal agent generating UI

It becomes law, not style.

⸻

Next logical step (do not skip)

Apply this as:

Global UI Governor
→ imported by WorldRoot / LevelManager / PatchRegistry

So no future patch can violate it even accidentally.

Once that’s done, the SWOT weakness stops being a risk and becomes a solved problem.

This is how systems mature without bloating.
