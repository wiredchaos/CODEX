# CRAB LEGS INDEX

## Transcripts under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`
- `VERCEL_HISTORY/README.md` (placeholder only; contains no transcript content).
- **NO EVIDENCE PROVIDED** for Vercel chats or patch transcripts. Add exported build transcripts (for example, `VERCEL_HISTORY/VERCEL_DUMP.md` or dated files) to populate this index.

## Data to extract when transcripts are added
For each transcript file, capture (only when explicitly present):
- Patch name
- Repo name
- Trinity/3DT indicators (e.g., 3DT, Trinity, EnvironmentRenderer, timeline doors)
- Whether a Consumer Declaration is included (YES/NO/UNKNOWN)

## Required files to proceed
- Exported Vercel chat/build transcripts added under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`.
- Any consumer-only declarations or mount notes contained in those transcripts.
