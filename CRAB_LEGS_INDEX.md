# CRAB Legs Index (Vercel Transcripts)

Scan result: `NO TRANSCRIPTS FOUND — NEED EXPORTS.` The `VERCEL_HISTORY/` directory was created for manifest tracking, but no tran
script text files (.md/.txt/.json) were present under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`, `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/`, or `VERCEL_HISTORY/incoming/
`.

When transcript exports are available, place them under `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/YYYY-MM-DD/` (or `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/undated
/` when no date is known). Each file should be listed in `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/_MANIFEST.json` and indexed below with evidence-
based fields only.
