# CRAB LEGS INDEX

## Transcripts under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`
- `VERCEL_HISTORY/README.md` (placeholder only; contains no transcript content).
- **NO EVIDENCE PROVIDED** for Vercel chats or patch transcripts. Add exported build transcripts (for example, `VERCEL_HISTORY/VERCEL_DUMP.md` or dated files) to populate this index.

## Data to extract when transcripts are added
For each transcript file, capture (only when explicitly present):
- Patch name
- Repo name
- Trinity/3DT indicators (e.g., 3DT, Trinity, EnvironmentRenderer, timeline doors)
- Whether a Consumer Declaration is included (YES/NO/UNKNOWN)

## Required files to proceed
- Exported Vercel chat/build transcripts added under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`.
- Any consumer-only declarations or mount notes contained in those transcripts.
# CRAB Legs Index (Vercel Transcripts)

Scan result: `NO TRANSCRIPTS FOUND — NEED EXPORTS.` The `VERCEL_HISTORY/` directory was created for manifest tracking, but no tran
script text files (.md/.txt/.json) were present under `VERCEL_HISTORY/`, `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/`, or `VERCEL_HISTORY/incoming/
`.

When transcript exports are available, place them under `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/YYYY-MM-DD/` (or `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/undated
/` when no date is known). Each file should be listed in `VERCEL_HISTORY/exports/_MANIFEST.json` and indexed below with evidence-
based fields only.
Status: `NO TRANSCRIPTS FOUND — NEED EXPORTS.` The `VERCEL_HISTORY/` directory is not present in this workspace, so no Vercel chat or build transcripts are available to index.

If transcripts are exported later, add them under `VERCEL_HISTORY/` and record them below with evidence-based fields only.
