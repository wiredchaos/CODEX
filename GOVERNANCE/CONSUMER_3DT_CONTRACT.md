# 3DT Consumer Contract

Any registry entry with `consumer_3dt=true` is a Trinity/3DT consumer. These consumers:
- **Do not own infrastructure.** Execution, scaling, and hosting stay under Wired Chaos control.
- **Do not control the runtime.** Scheduling, orchestration, and lifecycle management are enforced by WIRED CHAOS.
- **Inherit WIRED CHAOS execution, security, and lifecycle.** All security controls, audit trails, and deprecation policies apply automatically.

## Allowed Contributions
3DT consumers may supply:
- **Inputs:** Structured data, interaction parameters, and telemetry the runtime accepts.
- **Artifacts:** Files or proofs referenced in `PATCH_REGISTRY.json` for unlocks, validation, or continuity.
- **Content descriptors:** Narrative or media descriptors that the runtime can surface while retaining CODEX authority over truth.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries
3DT consumers may **never** override:
- **Execution order:** Timelines and routing are enforced by CODEX registry truth and WIRED CHAOS runtime.
- **Permissions:** Access rules, gating, and unlock conditions are set in the registry and enforced by runtime guardians.
- **Registry truth:** IDs, relationships, and statuses in `PATCH_REGISTRY.json` are authoritative.
- **Timeline authority:** Timeline composition, allowed skips, and linkage logic remain under CODEX and WIRED CHAOS governance.
